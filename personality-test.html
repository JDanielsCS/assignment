<h1 style="font-size: 50px;">Personality test</h1>
<h2>Myer Briggs</h2>
<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-personality">Myer Briggs personality test</a>
<p>The Myer Briggs test has identified me as an ENFP-A.<br>
ENFP-A's are enthusiastic people with strong people skills, and a desire to make deep connections with people.<br> The weaknesses are being disorganised, often unfocused, and often try too hard to please people.</p>

<p>Overall I would say this test was fairly accurate. I did this test 6 years ago and achieved the same result. </p>

<h2>Learning style test</h2>
<a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=7&V=6&T=7">Learning style</a>
<p>Your Scores:<br>
<br>
Auditory: 35%<br>
Visual: 30%<br>
Tactile: 35%<br>
I essentially scored even numbers, which really doesn't help me at all. I definitely learn better by doing, so I don't think this test is very accurate.</p>

<h2>Creativity test</h2>
<a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/creativity-quiz.htm">Creativity test</a>
<p>I scored 59 <br>
"Creativity is one of your strengths, and innovative and creative minds are highly sought after. So don't hide your ability! Look for ways to share your creativity process with others. Engage colleagues and teammates in creative pursuits, and promote creativity in your team and organization"<br>

This seems fairly accurate to me. I scored in the highest bracket, but right at the bottom of that bracket. Creativity in regards to problem solving is definitely a skill I need to work on in order for it to become a strong point of mine.
</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>
 <h3>• What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h3>

       <p> I believe the validity of these tests all comes down to how good you are at evaluating yourself. People are definitely inclined to lie on these tests without meaning to, as evaluating your own flaws is exponentially more difficult than evaluating someone elses. An interesting experiment is to get someone you're close to to answer these tests for you, as they are less likely to lie, and it will also give you an insight into how the world perceives you. <br>

        I asked my partner to fill in the Myer Briggs test for me, and I acheived the same result. That outcome, coupled with the description fitting me perfectly, leads me to believe the test is fairly accurate. In my case at least. <br>

        I will defnitely be having a think about the weaknesses of the ENFP trait, and how I can best overcome them to succeed in my studies.</p>

   <h3> • How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h3>
        <p>If the results are accurate, I should fit in seamlessly with any team. The main thing to consider according to the tests, is that I will be overly optimistic about what we can produce in the time frame, and also may get distracted and lose interest due to a new project idea.  I will keep these in mind when working as part of a team, and focus on the positive aspects of the personality type </p>



    <h3>• How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
       <p> Due to the personality type from the Myer Briggs test, I will work well in any team. I could be placed in a team of people that don't particularly enjoy team projects or leadership, and use my skills to get everyone to work together. Alternatively I could be placed in a team with some creative problem solvers, in order to learn off them and grow my skill set. Due to some of the reasons mentioned above the validity of these tests is questionable, but I will definitely keep in mind some of the weaknesses and strengths that resonated with me.</p>
