<p>This is the ideal job for me for a number of reasons. The main reason is this company creates software for other companies, be it startups or other companies. This is fantastic because it means there will be different challenges every day, and the learning would never stop. The skills that could be gained in this sort of job will transfer over to every programming job on the market. It also offers a great environment, work from home, and competitive salary.</p>

<h2>Technical experience:</h2>
    <h3>.net experience</h3>
        <p>Dot net is a software framework originally designed to build apps for Windows machines, but has since been updated to work on many different platforms. Dot Net supports 32 programming languages, but the most common requirements for a Dot net developer are C#, F# and Visual Basic. I have not learnt any of these languages, and would start with C#. This Udemy course: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/c-and-net-core-for-beginners/">https://www.udemy.com/course/c-and-net-core-for-beginners/</a> would be a great starting place, as it teaches C# and Dot net together.</p>

    <h3>Javascript</h3>
        <p>Javascript is a programming language used in web development. JavaScript is used alongside HTML and CSS to create interactive websites. Almost every developer job on Seek asks for JavaScript experience, because a lot of apps are turning to web based apps these days. I have not learnt JavaScript yet, however it is my top priority language to learn, and I am very excited for it. I will be using the following website to learn JavaScript: <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">https://www.theodinproject.com/</a></p>

    <h3>React.js</h3>
        <p>As the .js suggests, React is a very popular JavaScript library, that has become commonplace in web development roles. It allows you to create interactive user interfaces for your web applications. I see this a lot on job boards, so this is a skill I would pick up after learning the fundamentals of JavaScript.</p>


<h2>Extra:</h2>
    <h3>SQL</h3>
        <p>SQL is a programming language designed purely for managing data stored in a database. It is widely used to extract data from a database, and has been for over 40 years now. The syntax is quite simple and close to English, making it easy to learn. This particular job doesn't require it, but does have it in desirable skills. Therefore it is lower in my priorities to learn, but I will still like to understand it before I finish my Degree.</p> 


<h2>Non technical experience:</h2>
    <h3>Account management experience</h3>
        <p>I currently work as a key accounts manager for MBD in Tasmania, so this would be a smooth transition for me.</p>

    <h3>Project management / Leadership skills</h3>
        <p>In my current job I have a small team that I manage, and I learn more about management every day. By the time I have finished my Degree and learnt the required programming languages for this job, I will be very competent with both of these skills.</p>

    <h3>Reliable/Team player</h3>
        <p>I believe this is a strong point of mine already, so it should not be an issue</p>

    <h3>Ability to pick up technical ideas and concepts quickly.</h3>
        <p>This is a skill I am working on. There is a lot to learn in the IT field, and it seems like the more I learn the more I realise I don't know and understand. However, as my studies continue this is a skill I will focus on improving.</p>

<h2>Overall:</h2>

    <p>I have a long way to go before achieving this job. Above I have laid out my plan for learning the required languages, as well as some of the non-technical aspects. This is not an entry level job by any means. My plan is to first land a role as a junior software developer, and work my way up from there over the next decade. There is a lot to learn, but I am excited to be in this field now learning about it all, and I am very hopeful for the future of my career if I can keep it up.</p>
