    <h2>WKPI overview:</h2>
        <p>WKPI is a program that tracks KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for warehouse staff, and provides detailed reports for managers. The program is simple to use, and easy to set up in any warehouse situation. WKPI is an indispensable tool for any warehouse manager, the information it provides will allow them to make decisions regarding OH&S, wages, and rosters, with data to back them up.</p>

    <h2>Motivation:</h2> 
        <p>There are approcimately 35,700 warehouse storepersons in Australia alone, and currently there is not a single program that tracks their performance. There are many variations of programs to track sales KPIs. These track gross profits, total sales, average transactions, top selling products, and many more KPIs. These tracking programs have ben used for decades to pay sales staff commission, as well as to track down any areas of improvement that needs to happen. However, there are no programs to track anything similar for warehouse staff. This leads to unfair treatment, and lack of incentives. This is what WKPI aims to fix. </p>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>WKPI will track a number of duties performed every day by storepersons, and display the data in a format that's easy to read and track.
        tracked duties include <br>
                        1. deliveries picked<br>
                        2. purchase orders checked off<br>
                        3. items handed to customers<br>
                        4. Goods received<br><br>
        It will be customisable so a business can add or remove tracked duties at their will. Every time one of the tracked duties is completed, it will be inputted into the program under the storepersons ID. This will allow managers to see if staff are under performing, and also which staff are performing exceptionally. The data could be made available to the workers, and incentives could be applied to top performers, similar to how sales incentives work.<br><br>

        Another huge benifit of this program is the ability to track occupational health and safety risks. Repetitve strain injury is the most common claimed injury in store person work in Australia. Workers who spend long hours performing the same actions are at high risk of developing RSI. <br>
        With WKPI, you can easily track if a worker is repeating the same task too much, with no variation in their jobs. With the knowledge from WKPI's reports, you are able to get ahead of any injuries occuring by monitoring where they are spending their time and directing accordingly. This could save thousands in compensation and lost time.<br><br>

        The GUI would be as straight forward as possible. Technical proficiency is largely varied across warehouse managers, so ease of use is a huge necessity. The GUI will have a few simple buttons. Add staff, remove staff, input data, remove data, and add and remove tracked line. The report itself will be hosted online in a Domo web app. <br><br>

        Installation of the WKPI's to an existing business will be incredibly straight forward. You will be able to input all the users and data you need without having to edit the source code. It will come with some preset KPIs but those are able to be changed from the program.</p>



    <h2>Tools and Technologies:</h2>
        <p>The backend will be written in Python, and the data will be stored in Domo. There is a Python SDK called PyDomo, that would be used to input data into Domo. PyQT will also be used to create the GUI. Running the program will require an internet connection, and consume minimal memory on the device it's running on. The program won't need to be open all the time, only when changing data values. <br>

    <h2>Skills Required:</h2>
        <p>The skills required to write the program are fluency in Python, especially using lists, functions and data structures. A good understanding of how Domo operates, as well as PyDomo will be essential. PyQT willl be used to create the GUI. There is a program called QtDesigner that will help with coding that, as it allows you to drag and drop. Once written the program would be very simple to use, and every warehouse manager will be able to customise it to their needs.</p>



    <h2>Outcome:</h2>
        <p>Once the project is complete Warehouse managers will have an easier way to track staff performance, manage incentives, and motivate staff.
        Warehouse managers will be able to get ahead of occupational health and safety issues before they occur, savings thousands of dollars in compensation. 
        The staff will feel motivated to work at their optimal levels to hit KPIs. This will be a game changer for warehouses Australia wide, and fill a gap in the market that was missing.</p>
