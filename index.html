    <h2>My interests in IT</h2>
    <h3>• What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
    <p>My interest in IT started late High school, in the 10th grade. Before that year I had always been good at IT, but never really found too much interest in it. In grade 10 I had a teacher named Mr. Heidenreich, and his passion for IT was infectious. We were coding in Python, making games in GameMaker and Unity, and given a lot of freedom to take on any other projects we deemed interesting. I thrived under his guidance and looked forward to every class after that. I ended up winning the IT award at my school that year, certainly not due to any talent, but purely because of the passion I put into all my projects. </p>

    <h3>• Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)</h3>
	<p>As stated above, my grade 10 IT teacher Mr. Heidenreich truly sparked my passion. I never took much interest in school work, but after those classes I downloaded GameMaker, and After Effects studio on my home laptop and would play around with it every night. 
Once I started working full time, and moved into a share house, I definitely lost interest in IT, and even gaming for a small number of years. This was mostly due to the people I was around, as well as the lack of free time.</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple of years, and I needed as easier way to insert stocktakes at my new job. It didn't make sense to have to manually write the quanitites into three different programs, so I decided to make the process more efficient. This is when I remembered Python and some of the things I used to be able to do with it. After a few weeks of refresher training, I created a simple macro program to insert the stocktakes for me. It was like a spark had been re-ignited in me, and I became obsessed with all things IT, just like I used to be. I started rediscovering all the programs and games I used to love. After a year of playing around with programming, and gaming, I have decided to pursue a degree in computer science, in the hopes to land a job in the field.

	<h3>• Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
	<p>I chose RMIT as it has a prestigious reputation for computer science. They are ranked very well worldwide and it's growing every year.
The other reaosn I chose it was the response to Covid-19. They adapted completely to the challenges the coronavirus presented, and now the courses can be taken 100% online, aywhere in the world.</p>

<h3>• What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>
<p>I expect to learn a lot about how the world works. IT is all around us today, and there are almost no aspects of our lives that aren't intertwined with IT. To learn how IT works is to learn how the world works. I intend to continue with computer and programming courses, and learn the ins and outs of computers and IT systems. I expect to learn about social media and how that's changed the world, about data structures and algorithms, and also learn the skills I need to land a job in the industry.
